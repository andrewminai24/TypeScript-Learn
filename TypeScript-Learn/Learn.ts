Here is what TypeScript add from JavaScript
classes
private attributes
closures(With fat arrow syntax and intuitive variable scope)
decorators(roughly comparable to javas annotations)
getters and setters

But that's the catch: JavaScript uses a single idea -
 functions - to implement a variety of different concepts. 
 TypeScript uses dedicated keywords. 
This makes TypeScript code a pleasant read. 

Java forces you to declare trivial facts over and over again.
It doesnt
